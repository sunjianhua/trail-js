#trail-js
At the moment this in development - don't expect much working functionality from this.
It will eventually be a JavaScript navigation mesh pathfinding system.

## About

This library is extremely 'work in progress' but aimed at providing:

  * A framework agnostic navigation-mesh in JavaScript - just raw JavaScript
  * A simple navigation-mesh editor
  * Easy to implement A* pathfinding as part of the library


## Install

Presuming you have Node.js installed - use Terminal to navigate to the library directory and type (you may have to su):

  * `npm install`


## Run

There are two options once the dependencies have installed:

  * `gulp examples` builds the current source and launches a webserver at http://localhost:8080 for the libraries examples
  * `gulp` this is currently a developer-mode (includes watch and rebuild tasks)
